# Part 3E: Demonstrate calculate_CI()

## 1. Pick any dataset you wish from TidyTuesday to analyze.

### Question

Based on the data frame of survivalists across all 9 seasons: Did males live longer than females? How many loadouts every survivalists has taken?

### Original data

Data comes from TidyTuesday, which is a weekly podcast and global community activity brought to you by the R4DS Online Learning Community. [Archive of datasets from the 2023 series of *TidyTuesday* events](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2023)  <br>

[Data Source for this project](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-01-24/readme.md)

### data dictionary

Here is a data dictionary for what all the column names mean: [data dictionary](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2023/2023-01-24#data-dictionary)


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
if (!require("tidyverse", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("tidyverse", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
}

if (!require("tidytuesdayR", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("tidytuesdayR", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
}

if (!require("here", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("here", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
}

if (!require("ggplot2", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("ggplot2", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
}

library("tidytuesdayR")
library("here")
library("tidyverse")
```

## 2. Load the data into R

In this project, one datasets comes from TidyTuesday would be used. Specifically, we will use the following data from January 24th 2023. To access the data, you need to install the *tidytuesdayR* R package and use the function *tt_load()* with the date of '2023-01-24' to load the data.

```{r}
# tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2023-01-24')
# survivalists <- tuesdata$survivalists

# tests if a directory named "data" exists locally
if (!dir.exists(here("data"))) {
    dir.create(here("data"))
}

if (!file.exists(here("data", "tuesdata_survivalists.csv"))) {
    tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load("2023-01-24")
    survivalists <- tuesdata$survivalists
    loadouts <- tuesdata$loadouts

    # save the files to RDS objects
    write.csv(tuesdata$survivalists, file = here("data", "tuesdata_survivalists.csv"))
    write.csv(tuesdata$loadouts, file = here("data", "tuesdata_loadouts.csv"))
}

survivalists <- read.csv(here("data", "tuesdata_survivalists.csv"))
loadouts <- read.csv(here("data", "tuesdata_loadouts.csv"))
```

## 3. data wrangling and data visualization

# filter 'country' contains "United States"

## Plot 1: Kaplan-Meier survival curves
```{r}

          plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11, face = "italic" ,hjust = 0.5),
      )
```

## plot 3:
```{r}

      ggplot( aes(age, days_lasted) ) +
      geom_smooth() +
      facet_grid(~gender) +

      ) +
      theme(
          plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold",hjust = 0.5),
          plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10, face = "italic" ,hjust = 0.5),
      )
```

## 5. Summarize
There is some evidence to suggest that women, on average, survive longer than men. The rules allow each survivalist to take 10 items with them. The minimum number of loadouts taken by survivalist is 1, the maximum number of loadouts taken by survivalist is 10, and the mean number is 5.5 items. 

## 6. Function used
`dplyr`: mutate, left_join, count, group_by
`tidyr`: replace_na, expand_grid, 
`ggplot2`: geom_line, geom_boxplot, geom_jitter, geom_smooth
Two functions from purrr: map, map_lgl
2 functions from the R package `maxSiyu`: maximum, minimum
